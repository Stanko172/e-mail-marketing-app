<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

E-mail marketing application is software that store subsribers and allows us to send e-mails to them. But it also comes with a great set of more complex features,
such as:

Features:
* Managing subscribers.
* Tagging them. Tags are helpful to filter subscribers when you want to send e-mails.
* Sending broadcast (or one-time) e-mails. You write the content, set the filters, and hit
the Send button.
* Creating sequences. A sequence is a collection of e-mails delivered to subscribers after
a certain delay. For example, you write four e-mails, and you want to send these e-
mails in four weeks. You can create a sequence that does precisely that automatically.
And the great thing about sequences is that they handle new subscribers as well. So if
you create this sequence in February and a person subscribes in May, they will still be
added to it and get one e-mail per week.
* Adding subscribers to sequences based on specific criteria. We can also create
different filters. For example, we want to exclude subscribers who bought a particular
product or have a specific tag.
* Creating subscription forms where people can enter their e-mail addresses. You can
build an HTML form with an e-mail input that can be embedded into your site. If
someone submits this form, they will be added to your e-mail list.
* Tracking e-mail opens, and link clicks.
* Generating reports from these metrics.
